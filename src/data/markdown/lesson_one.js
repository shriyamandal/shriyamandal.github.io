const lesson_one = `# About Me

Hi there! My name is Shriya and I'm a first year computer science major from Raleigh, NC. I have lived in six states in total - North Carolina, Indiana, Oregon, California, Michigan and Illinois! I have also lived in the UK for 5 years. 

I am still working on setting up this site so it is really barebones right now.
